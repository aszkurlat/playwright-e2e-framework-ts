# Playwright E2E Framework (TypeScript)

This repository contains a complete **E2E automation framework** built with **Playwright + TypeScript**, demonstrating a real-world project structure based on Page Object Model (POM), fixtures, reusable test data, and suite tagging (smoke / regression).

The framework uses the **SauceDemo** application as the target system under test.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- Page Object Model (POM)
- Authentication via storageState (global login)
- Custom authenticated fixture
- Clear test suite grouping (smoke vs regression)
- Parallel execution across Chromium, Firefox, WebKit
- Clean project structure suitable for team environments
- Data-driven testing (separate test data files)

## 🧩 Page Object Model (POM)

Each page in the application is represented by a dedicated class:

### **LoginPage**
- login action  
- locators for username, password, error messages  
- navigation to main login page  

### **ProductsPage**
- add product to cart  
- sorting functionality  
- menu interactions  
- navigation to cart  

### **CartPage**
- validate cart page  
- remove item  
- proceed to checkout  
- check cart item count  

### **CheckoutPage**
- fill checkout form  
- validation for required fields  
- finishing the order  
- asserting order confirmation  

This clear separation makes tests small, readable, and easy to maintain.

## 🔐 Authentication (storageState)

Initial authentication is performed once in:

global-setup.ts

It logs in with a valid user and saves session data to:

storageStates/standardUser.json

Tests that import the authenticated fixture:

```ts
import { test, expect } from "../../fixtures/authFixture";
```

start already logged in.

Tests that import:
```ts
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";
```
run without stored authentication and perform manual login inside the test.

## 🧪 Test Suites
🔹 Smoke

Fast, critical path test:

login-positive.spec.ts
(@smoke tag)

Run:

npm run test:smoke

🔹 Regression

Full functional coverage:

login-negative.spec.ts

cart-remove-item.spec.ts

checkout-happy-path.spec.ts

navigation-logout.spec.ts

All contain tag: @regression

Run:

npm run test:regression

▶️ Running All Tests

Install dependencies:

npm install
npx playwright install


Run entire project:

npx playwright test


Run in UI mode:

npx playwright test --ui


Open HTML report:

npx playwright show-report

## 🎯 Summary

This framework demonstrates:

Realistic Playwright automation structure

Clean separation of responsibilities

Reusable POM classes

Authentication fixture setup

Data-driven test files

Taged test suites (smoke/regression)

Fully working E2E flows (login, cart, checkout, logout)

It is ready to be presented to employers or used as a foundation for a larger automation system.
